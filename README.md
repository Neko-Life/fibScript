# fibScript
An interpreted language that only runs the Fibonacci sequence.

## Documentation
You can run the Fibonacci sequence to X places, like so:
```
fib(X)
```
That's all. That's the language.
### Example
```
fib(5)
```
Would return:
```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181
```
## Usage
Run in the command line:
```
python fibscript.py filename.fs
```
FibScript files are followed by the fs extension.

### Install Instructions
Just download fibscript.py from the repo, that's literally the only file needed.
