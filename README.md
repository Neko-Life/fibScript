# fibScript
An interpreted language that only runs the Fibonacci sequence.

## Documentation
You can run the Fibonacci sequence to X places, like so:
```
fib(X)
```
The program can have multiple lines, split by new lines (not semicolons.)

That's all. That's the language.
### Example
```
fib(5)
```
Would return:
```
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
```
## Usage
Run in the command line:
```
python fibscript.py filename.fs
```
Or, on Linux:
```
python3 fibscript.py filename.fs
```
FibScript files are followed by the fs extension.

### Install Instructions
Just download fibscript.py from the repo, that's literally the only file needed.

Yes, FibScript is written in Python. Kindly, get over it.
